first step is session id (from client)
ack the id from server

second step is key negotiation handshake:
    propose from client,
    propose from server, 
    they calculate the key offline

client sends req for file (includes session id and path, chunks are XOR'd with key)

server: 
file -> base64, XOR chunks with key, put into proto and send

client:
recieve and run checksum, then send back checksum. if it doesn't match drop the packet, else decrypt the chunk and append the b64 to the ongoing fd

server:
if the resp checksum matches then send the next chunk, else resend the prev

at the end, send one w/ final checksum from server to client. Client does final checkum of its copy and if they don't match they try the whole thing again
